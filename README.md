### What I learned

On first glance, this challenge looks pretty simple and easy. I struggle a lot, especially with illustrations, because most of them have white spaces and overflows on their parent element. I haven't done this kind of design before, I thought that the assets given to the developer are already fixed and all we have to do is to put the images in the right places. I really underestimated this challenge. Overall, I enjoyed and learned a lot from this challenge, and I'm planning to do more of these kinds of challenges.
